# EventMatch

## Overview

EventMatch is a location-based event discovery and matching platform that connects event organizers with attendees. The application features a swipe-based interface similar to dating apps, where attendees can discover events near them by swiping right to show interest or left to pass. When both an attendee shows interest in an event and the event organizer approves, a "match" is created, enabling direct communication.

The platform serves two primary user types: event organizers who can create and manage events, and attendees who can discover and engage with events in their area. The system includes geolocation features, real-time matching algorithms, and comprehensive event management tools.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool
- **UI Library**: Shadcn/UI components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens and CSS variables
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state and caching
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive layouts optimized for mobile devices

### Backend Architecture
- **Server Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with standardized error handling
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage
- **Request Logging**: Custom middleware for API request/response logging
- **Static Assets**: Vite development server integration with production static serving

### Authentication System
- **Provider**: Replit's OIDC (OpenID Connect) authentication
- **Strategy**: Passport.js with OpenID Client strategy
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions using connect-pg-simple
- **User Management**: Automatic user creation/updates from OIDC claims
- **Security**: HTTP-only cookies with secure flags for production

### Database Architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless hosting
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with type-safe schema definitions
- **Schema Design**: 
  - Users table with role-based access (organizer/attendee)
  - Events table with geolocation and categorization
  - Matches table for tracking attendee-event connections
  - Event interactions for analytics (views, likes)
  - Sessions table for authentication state
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management and migrations

### Geolocation Features
- **User Location**: Browser geolocation API for attendee positioning
- **Event Discovery**: Distance-based event filtering using latitude/longitude
- **Location Storage**: Decimal precision coordinates in PostgreSQL
- **Privacy**: Location data only used for event matching, not stored permanently

### Data Layer
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer with DatabaseStorage implementation
- **Connection Management**: Connection pooling with Neon serverless
- **Query Optimization**: Indexed queries for geolocation and user lookups
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration from database to frontend

### Event Management System
- **Event Creation**: Rich form interface with image uploads and categorization
- **Status Management**: Draft and active event states
- **Analytics**: View and interaction tracking for event performance
- **Capacity Management**: Optional attendance limits and pricing

### Matching Algorithm
- **Swipe Interface**: Card-based UI with gesture recognition
- **Interest Tracking**: Binary like/pass system for events
- **Match Creation**: Bidirectional interest confirmation
- **Notification System**: Real-time match notifications with visual feedback

## External Dependencies

### Cloud Services
- **Neon Database**: PostgreSQL hosting with serverless architecture
- **Replit Authentication**: OIDC provider for user management
- **Replit Hosting**: Development and production deployment platform

### Core Libraries
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL client optimized for serverless environments
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management and caching
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible UI component primitives
- **passport**: Authentication middleware with OpenID Connect strategy

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Build tool with hot module replacement and development server
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking across the entire stack
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **ESBuild**: Fast bundling for production builds

### UI and Styling
- **Shadcn/UI**: Pre-built component library based on Radix UI
- **Class Variance Authority**: Component variant management
- **Tailwind Merge**: Utility class conflict resolution
- **Lucide React**: Icon library for consistent iconography

### Form and Validation
- **React Hook Form**: Form state management with validation
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation and schema definition
- **@hookform/resolvers**: Zod integration for form validation

The application is designed as a modern, type-safe full-stack application with strong separation of concerns between the frontend React application, Express backend API, and PostgreSQL database layer. The architecture supports both development and production environments with appropriate tooling for each phase.
