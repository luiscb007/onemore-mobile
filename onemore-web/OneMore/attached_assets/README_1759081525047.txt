EVENTMATCH - Location-Based Event Discovery Platform
=================================================

OVERALL OBJECTIVE:
EventMatch is a mobile-optimized, location-based event discovery and matching platform that connects event organizers with attendees through an intuitive swipe-based interface. Users can switch between two modes: discovering events as an attendee or creating/managing events as an organizer. The app features real-time geolocation matching, comprehensive event management tools, and a streamlined authentication flow with emoji-based UI design.

KEY FEATURES:
- Swipe-based event discovery (Going/Like/Pass system)
- Role switching between Attendee and Organizer modes
- Location-based event matching using coordinates
- Event creation, editing, and capacity management
- Real-time event feedback and attendance tracking
- Mobile-first responsive design with touch-optimized interface
- Replit authentication integration
- Category-based event filtering (Arts, Community, Culture, Sports, Workshops)

TECHNOLOGY STACK:
- Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- Backend: Express.js + TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- Authentication: Replit OAuth
- Styling: TailwindCSS + Shadcn/UI components
- Routing: Wouter (lightweight React router)
- State Management: TanStack Query (React Query)

└── utils.ts - General utility functions and class name helpers

SERVER/ DIRECTORY (Backend):
----------------------------
index.ts - Express server entry point
         - Sets up middleware, authentication, and starts server

routes.ts - API route definitions and handlers
          - Event CRUD operations (/api/events/*)
          - User management (/api/users/*)
          - Event feedback system (/api/event-feedback/*)
          - Authentication routes (/api/auth/*)

db.ts - Database schema definitions using Drizzle ORM
      - Defines tables: users, events, eventFeedback, sessions
      - Includes relationships and constraints

storage.ts - Data access layer and business logic
           - Database queries and data transformation
           - Event filtering and location-based matching
           - User and feedback management functions

replitAuth.ts - Replit OAuth authentication setup
              - Passport.js configuration
              - Session management

vite.ts - Vite development server integration for full-stack development

DATABASE STRUCTURE:
------------------
The app uses PostgreSQL with these main tables:
- users: User profiles with role (attendee/organizer), location data
- events: Event information, location, capacity, organizer details
- eventFeedback: User responses to events (going/like/not_interested)
- sessions: User session management

ADDITIONAL DIRECTORIES:
----------------------
uploads/ - File storage for uploaded event images
attached_assets/ - Generated images and assets for the application

DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW:
====================
1. Run "npm run dev" to start both client (Vite) and server (Express)
2. Frontend runs on port 5000 (configured for Replit)
3. Backend API routes are proxied through Vite dev server
4. Database operations use Drizzle ORM with automatic migrations
5. Authentication handled through Replit OAuth system

KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS:
===========================
- Mobile-first design with touch-optimized interface (min 44px touch targets)
- Single Page Application (SPA) with client-side routing
- Real-time updates using React Query for cache management
- Location-based matching using latitude/longitude coordinates
- Role-based access control with dynamic UI switching
- Emoji-based visual design for enhanced user experience
- Terminology: "Going" (committed), "Like" (interested), "Pass" (not interested)

This structure provides a scalable, maintainable platform for event discovery
and management with clear separation of concerns between frontend, backend,
and shared utilities.
