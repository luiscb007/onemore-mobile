I recently started working with React Native using Expo to build my first mobile app. Things were going great — I shipped a first version to TestFlight, no problem. But then, I pushed an update (v1.1.0), and everything broke.

The app opened to a blank screen. No crash. No error. Just… nothing.

I searched Reddit, GitHub issues, StackOverflow — found dozens of posts describing the same problem:

“My app works in Expo Go, but in TestFlight it just shows a blank screen.”

But no real answers.

So after hours of trial and error (and wasting several TestFlight builds), I figured it out. And I’m writing this post in case it helps someone else avoid that pain.

How I Found the Problem
The app worked fine in Expo Go, but once I installed it through TestFlight, it was just a blank screen. I had no logs, no crash, no error — nothing. Here’s exactly how I debugged it:

1. Build a Preview Version
Since I couldn’t reproduce the issue in Expo Go, I built a preview build for the iOS Simulator:

npx eas-cli build - platform ios - profile preview
I made sure my eas.json had this simulator flag on under the preview profile:

"preview": {
  "distribution": "internal",
  "ios": {
    "simulator": true
  }
}
This creates a .app file (instead of a .ipa) that works on the macOS iOS Simulator.

2. Run the App on the Simulator
After the build finished:

I downloaded the .app file from the Expo build page (if you are building locally you’ll have it there)
Then installed it using:
xcrun simctl install booted /path/to/your.app
Then I opened the app on the simulator

3. Open Console.app and Filter Logs
To see what was going wrong:

Open the Console app (just search for “Console” in Spotlight)
In the left sidebar, select your simulator device under the “Devices” section
Click the “Errors and Faults” filter above the log table to filter the errors
Add a search filter for your app name using the search bar (PROCESS: YOUR_APP_NAME)
Launch the app in the simulator and watch the logs roll in
I found a bunch of logs with errors but the one that did the trick was this one:

[runtime not ready]: Invariant Violation: TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing(...): 
'RNGestureHandlerModule' could not be found. 
Verify that a module by this name is registered in the native binary., js engine: hermes
RNGestureHandlerModule is the native module for react-native-gesture-handler.

My code(or a dependency, like React Navigation) is trying to use this module, but it is not present in the native binary.

The Cause
After googling the error, I found out:

Some native modules are available in Expo Go, but are not automatically included in your standalone EAS builds.

So if your app (or a dependency like React Navigation) needs react-native-gesture-handler, you have to explicitly install it:

npx expo install react-native-gesture-handler
Final Steps
I installed the missing package, rebuilt the preview app, tested it in the simulator again — and it worked. After confirming it was fixed, I created a new production build and submitted it to TestFlight.

The app was finally working again on my phone.

Lessons (painfully) Learned
💻 Preview builds save hours. Don’t go straight to production — use eas build — profile preview and test in the iOS simulator first.
🧠 Expo Go is not your production app. It includes many prebuilt native modules that your standalone build will not include unless you explicitly install them.
🧩 Missing native modules crash silently. If you’re using libraries like React Navigation, make sure all required native dependencies (like react-native-gesture-handler) are installed.
📝 You must commit before cloud builds. Expo’s EAS cloud builds only use the last committed state. I built the same broken version three times without realizing my local fixes weren’t included 😅.
🔎 Logs don’t show in TestFlight. If your app fails to launch, you won’t see why unless you test locally or use a crash reporting tool.
🛠 macOS Console is your best friend. Open Console.app, filter by your app name and “Errors and Faults”, and you’ll see what’s really breaking under the hood.
📉 You’re blind without JS logs. In production, console.log() is gone. Tools like Sentry or Bugsnag can help track runtime errors.
🧪 Add logs in key places. I added console.log()s at every startup stage — and none of them showed up. That told me the JS bundle wasn’t even loading.
⚙️ babel.config.js and tsconfig.json changes matter. I made tweaks to both (like using path aliases) and didn’t realize they could affect build output in production.
🧱 A missing dependency can break everything. The app didn’t crash — it just never started. That’s way harder to debug without knowing where to look.
👷 Add an error boundary. Once I realized I had none, I added one — it won’t fix native crashes, but it helps catch unexpected runtime errors in production JS.
